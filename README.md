# SortingVisualizer

This web app visualizes the following sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort and heap sort.

This app is deployed with Netlify and can be accessed here: sortalgovisualizer.netlify.app. I hope you have fun playing around with it.

## Purpose of this project

I wanted to improve my skills with javascript and revise my knowledge on sorting algorithms. The app was built from the ground up, and the entirety of the desing, html, javascript, and sass/css was done by me.

## Code organization

The ```src``` directory contains the js, sass and img subdirectories.
